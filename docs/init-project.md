### Husky (version 9.1.7)

Husky is a tool that is used to manage git hooks. It helps us to run certain commands before we commit the code to the repository.

For example, we can use husky to run a linter before we commit the code. This way we can avoid pushing the code to the repository with errors.

### Lint-staged (version 15.2.10)

Lint-staged is a tool that is used to run a linter on the code that is staged (ready to be committed). It helps us to avoid pushing the code to the repository with errors.
